changes impersonate users see org apache hadoop security usergroupinformation either ambari cloudera manager directly on namenode s core site xml file add properties user we wish use proxy replace with simple user name not fully qualified principal name hadoop proxyuser hosts hosts proxy user allowed perform impersonated actions on behalf valid user from hadoop proxyuser groups groups

would have power impersonate specific subset users cluster from specific machine use hadoop proxyuser hosts property whenever possible practical don t give proxyusername s password keytab any user you

date time configuration dialog you will need previously define your configuration file command line getting started output terminal generate interactive report goaccess access log generate html report goaccess access log report html generate json report goaccess access log d o json report json generate csv file goaccess access log no csv summary o csv report csv goaccess also allows great flexibility real time filtering parsing instance quickly diagnose issues by monitoring logs since goaccess was started tail f access log goaccess even better filter while maintaining opened pipe preserve real time analysis we can make use tail f matching pattern tool such grep awk sed etc tail f access log grep i line buffered firefox goaccess log format combined parse from beginning file while maintaining pipe opened applying filter tail f n access log grep i line buffered firefox goaccess o report html real time html multiple log files there are several ways parse multiple logs with goaccess simplest pass multiple log files command line goaccess access log access log s even possible parse files from pipe while reading regular files cat access log goaccess access log access log note single dash appended command line let goaccess know that should read from pipe now if we want add more flexibility goaccess we can use zcat force read compressed uncompressed files instance if we would like process all log files access log we can do zcat force access log goaccess note on mac os x use gunzip c instead zcat real time html outputs goaccess has ability output real time data html report you can even email html file since composed single file with no external file dependencies how neat that process generating real time html report very similar process creating static report real time html needed make real time goaccess access log o usr share nginx html your site report html real time html view report you can navigate http your site report html by default goaccess will use host name generated report optionally you can specify url which client s browser will connect see faq more detailed example goaccess access log o report html real time html ws url goaccess io by default goaccess listens on port use different port other than you can specify make sure port opened goaccess access log o report html real time html port bind websocket server different address other than you can specify goaccess access log o report html real time html addr note output real time data over tls ssl connection you need use ssl cert ssl key filtering working with dates another useful pipe would filtering dates out web log following will get all http requests starting on dec until end file sed n dec p access log goaccess using relative dates such yesterdays tomorrows day sed n date d b y d week ago p access log goaccess if we want parse certain time frame from date date b we can do sed n nov dec p access log goaccess if we want preserve certain amount data recycle storage we can keep certain number days instance keep show last days goaccess access log keep last virtual hosts assuming your log contains virtual host field instance vhost io mar get shop http googlebot image you would like append virtual host request order see which virtual host top urls belong awk access log goaccess do same but also use real time filtering parsing tail f access log unbuffer p awk goaccess exclude list virtual hosts you can do following grep v cat exclude vhost list file vhost access log goaccess files status codes bots parse specific pages e g page views html htm php etc within request awk html htm php access log goaccess note request field common combined log format without virtual host if your log includes virtual host then you probably want use instead s best check which field you are shooting e g tail access log awk print parse specific status code e g internal server error awk access log goaccess multiple status codes e g all xx xx tail f n access log awk goaccess o out html get estimated overview how many bots crawlers are hitting your server tail f n access log grep i line buffered bot goaccess tips also worth pointing out that if we want run goaccess at lower priority we can run nice n goaccess f access log if you don t want install on your server you can still run from your local machine ssh n root server tail f var log apache access log goaccess note ssh requires n so goaccess can read from stdin also make sure use ssh keys authentication won t work if passphrase required troubleshooting we receive many questions issues that have been answered previously date time matching problems check that your log format system locale which you run goaccess match see problems with pattern matching spaces are often problem see instance other issues matching log entries see closed issues regarding log date time formats problems with log processing see issues regarding log processing incremental log processing goaccess has ability process logs incrementally through its internal storage dump its data disk works following way dataset must persisted first with persist then same dataset can loaded with restore if new data passed piped through log file will append original dataset notes goaccess keeps track inodes all files processed assuming files will stay on same partition addition extracts snippet data from log along with last line parsed each file timestamp last line parsed e g inode line ts first compares if snippet matches log being parsed if does assumes log hasn t changed drastically e g hasn t been truncated if inode does not match current file parses all lines if current file matches inode then reads remaining lines updates count lines parsed timestamp extra precaution won t parse log lines with timestamp than one stored piped data works based off timestamp last line read instance will parse discard all incoming entries until finds timestamp than one stored examples last month access log goaccess access log persist then load with append this month access log preserve new data goaccess access log restore persist read persisted data without parsing new data goaccess restore contributing any help on

interface interface machine learning models python python notebook ui ui components ": " welcome gradio quickly create beautiful user interfaces around your machine learning models gradio pronounced gray dee oh makes easy you demo your model your browser let people try out by dragging dropping their own images pasting text recording their own voice etc seeing what model outputs gradio useful demoing your machine learning models clients collaborators users students deploying your models quickly with automatic shareable links getting feedback on model performance debugging your model interactively during development using built manipulation interpretation tools you can find interactive version following getting started at https gradio app getting started getting started prerequisite python that s quick start get gradio running with simple hello world example follow these three steps install gradio from pip bash pip install gradio run code below python script python notebook colab notebook python import gradio gr def greet name return hello name iface gr interface fn greet inputs text outputs text iface launch interface below will appear automatically within python notebook pop browser on http localhost if running from script understanding interface class gradio can wrap almost any python function with easy use user interface example above we saw simple text based function but function could anything from image enhancer tax calculator most commonly prediction function pretrained machine learning model core interface class initialized with three parameters fn function wrap inputs input component type s e g image audio see docs complete list outputs output component type s e g image label see docs complete list with these three arguments we can quickly create interfaces launch them but what if you want change how ui components look behave customizable components let s say we want customize input text field example we wanted larger have text hint if we use actual input class textbox instead using string shortcut we have access much more customizability see list all components we support how you can customize them check out docs python import gradio gr def greet name return hello name iface gr interface fn greet inputs gr inputs textbox lines placeholder name here outputs text iface launch multiple inputs outputs let s say we had much more complex function with multiple inputs outputs example below we have function that takes string boolean number returns string number take look how we pass list input output components python import gradio gr def greet name morning temperature salutation good morning if morning else good evening greeting s s s degrees today salutation name temperature celsius temperature return greeting round celsius iface gr interface fn greet inputs text checkbox gr inputs slider outputs text number iface launch we simply wrap components list each component inputs list corresponds one parameters function order each component outputs list corresponds one values returned by function again order working with images let s try image image function when using image component your function will receive numpy array your specified size with shape width height where last dimension represents rgb values we ll return image well form numpy array python import numpy numpy import gradio gr def sepia input img sepia filter numpy array sepia img input img dot sepia filter t sepia img sepia img max return sepia img iface gr interface sepia gr inputs image shape image iface launch additionally our image input interface comes with edit button which opens tools cropping flipping rotating drawing over applying filters images we ve found that manipulating images this way will often reveal hidden flaws model addition images gradio supports other media input types such audio video uploads well many output components read about these docs working with dataframes graphs you can use gradio support inputs outputs from your typical data libraries such numpy arrays pandas dataframes plotly graphs take look at demo below ignore complicated data manipulation function python import matplotlib pyplot plt import numpy numpy import pandas pandas import gradio gr def sales projections employee data sales data employee data iloc astype int numpy regression values numpy apply along axis lambda row numpy array numpy poly d numpy polyfit row sales data projected months numpy repeat numpy expand dims numpy arange len sales data axis projected values numpy array month month regression month regression regression month regression zip projected months regression values plt plot projected values t plt legend employee data name return employee data plt gcf regression values iface gr interface sales projections gr inputs dataframe headers name jan sales feb sales mar sales default jon alice sana dataframe plot numpy description enter sales figures employees predict sales trajectory over year iface launch example inputs you can provide example data that user can easily load into model this can helpful demonstrate types inputs model expects well provide way explore your dataset conjunction with your model load example data you provide nested list examples keyword argument interface constructor each sublist within outer list represents data sample each element within sublist represents input each input component format example data each component specified docs python import gradio gr def calculator num operation num if operation add return num num elif operation subtract return num num elif operation multiply return num num elif operation divide return num num iface gr interface calculator number gr inputs radio add subtract multiply divide number number examples add divide multiply subtract title test calculator description heres sample toy calculator enjoy flagging options this that iface launch you can load large dataset into examples browse interact with dataset through gradio examples will automatically paginated you can configure this through examples per page argument interface you can use ctrl arrow keys navigate through examples quickly live interfaces you can make interfaces automatically refresh by setting live true interface now interface will recalculate soon user input changes python import gradio gr def calculator num operation num if operation add return num num elif operation subtract return num num elif operation multiply return num num elif operation divide return num num iface gr interface calculator number gr inputs radio add subtract multiply divide number number live true iface launch note there no submit button because interface resubmits automatically on change using state your function may use data that persists beyond single function call if data something accessible all function calls all users you can create global variable outside function call access inside function example you may load large model outside function use inside function so that every function call does not need reload model another type data persistence gradio supports session state where data persists across multiple submits within page load however data not shared between different users your model store data session state you need do three things pass extra parameter into your function which represents state interface at end function return updated value state extra return value add state input state output components when creating your interface see chatbot example below python import random import gradio gr def chat message history history history if message startswith how many response random randint elif message startswith how response random choice great good okay bad elif message startswith where response random choice here there somewhere else response i don t know history append message response html user msg resp msg history html f user msg html f resp msg html return html history iface gr interface chat text state html state css chatbox display flex flex direction column user msg resp msg padding px margin bottom px border radius px width user msg background color cornflowerblue color white align self start resp msg background color lightgray align self self end allow screenshot false allow flagging never iface launch notice how state persists across submits within each page but state not shared between two pages some more points note you can pass default value state parameter which used initial value state state must something that can serialized json format e g dictionary list single value typically objects will not work flagging underneath output interfaces there button marked flag when user testing your model sees input with interesting output such erroneous unexpected model behaviour they can flag input interface creator review within directory provided by flagging dir argument interface constructor csv file will log flagged inputs if interface involves file data such image audio components folders will created store those flagged data well example with calculator interface shown above we would have flagged data stored flagged directory shown below directory calculator py flagged logs csv flagged logs csv csv num operation num output add subtract with sepia interface shown above we would have flagged data stored flagged directory shown below directory sepia py flagged logs csv im png png output png png flagged logs csv csv im output im png output png im png output png you can review these flagged inputs by manually exploring flagging directory load them into examples gradio interface by pointing examples argument flagged directory if you wish user provide reason flagging you can pass list strings flagging options argument interface users will have select one strings when flagging which will saved additional column csv sharing interfaces publicly interfaces can easily shared publicly by setting share true launch method like this python gr interface classify image image label launch share true this generates public shareable link that you can send anybody when you send this link user on other side can try out model their browser because processing happens on your device long your device stays on you don t have worry about any packaging any dependencies if you re working out colab notebook share link always automatically created usually looks something like this xxxxx gradio app although link served through gradio link we are proxy your local server do not store any data sent through interfaces keep mind however that these links are publicly accessible meaning that anyone can use your model prediction therefore make sure not expose any sensitive information through functions you write allow any critical changes occur on your device if you set share false default local link created which can shared by port forwarding with specific users share links expire after hours permanent hosting see hosting gradio apps on spaces below hosting gradio apps on spaces huggingface provides infrastructure permanently host your gradio model on internet free you can either drag drop folder containing your gradio model all related files you can point hf spaces your git repository hp spaces will pull gradio interface from there see huggingface spaces more information advanced features here we go through several advanced functionalities that your gradio demo can include without you needing write much more code authentication you may wish put authentication page front your interface limit who can open your interface with auth keyword argument launch method you can pass list acceptable username password tuples more complex authentication handling you can even pass function that takes username password arguments returns true allow authentication false otherwise here s example that provides password based authentication single user named admin python gr interface fn classify image inputs image outputs label launch auth admin pass interpreting your predictions most models are black boxes such that internal logic function hidden from end user encourage transparency we ve made very easy add interpretation your model by simply setting interpretation keyword interface class default this allows your users understand what parts input are responsible output take look at simple interface below which shows image classifier that also includes interpretation python import requests import tensorflow tensorflow import gradio gr inception net tensorflow keras applications mobilenetv load model download human readable labels imagenet response requests get https git io jjkyn labels response text split n def classify image inp inp inp reshape inp tensorflow keras applications mobilenet v preprocess input inp prediction inception net predict inp flatten return labels i float prediction i i range image gr inputs image shape label gr outputs label num top classes gr interface fn classify image inputs image outputs label interpretation default launch addition default gradio also includes shapley based interpretation which provides more accurate interpretations albeit usually with slower runtime use this simply set interpretation parameter shap note also make sure python package shap installed optionally you can modify num shap parameter which controls tradeoff between accuracy runtime increasing this value generally increases accuracy here example python gr interface fn classify image inputs image outputs label interpretation shap num shap launch this will work any function even if internally model complex neural network some other black box if you use gradio s default shap interpretation output component must label all common input components are supported here example with text input python import re import gradio gr male words female words he his him she hers her def gender sentence sentence male count len word word sentence split if word lower male words female count len word word sentence split if word lower female words total max male count female count return male male count total female female count total iface gr interface fn gender sentence inputs gr inputs textbox default she went his house get her keys outputs label interpretation default iface launch so what happening under hood with these interpretation methods gradio runs prediction multiple times with modified versions input based on results you ll see that interface automatically highlights parts text image etc that contributed increased likelihood class red intensity color corresponds importance that part input parts that decrease class confidence are highlighted blue you can also write your own interpretation function demo below adds custom interpretation previous demo this function will take same inputs main wrapped function output this interpretation function will used highlight input each input interface therefore number outputs here corresponds number input interfaces see format interpretation each input interface check docs python import re import gradio gr male words female words he his him she hers her def gender sentence sentence male count len word word sentence split if word lower male words female count len word word sentence split if word lower female words total max male count female count return male male count total female female count total def interpret gender sentence result gender sentence sentence male result male result female interpretation word re split sentence score token word lower if male token male words not male token female words score elif male token female words not male token male words score interpretation append word score return interpretation iface gr interface fn gender sentence inputs gr inputs textbox default she went his house get her keys outputs label interpretation interpret gender enable queue true iface launch themes custom styling if you d like change how your interface looks you can select different theme by simply passing theme parameter like so python gr interface fn classify image inputs image outputs label theme huggingface launch here are themes we currently support default huggingface grass peach dark themes corresponding each these darkdefault darkhuggingface darkgrass darkpeach if you d like have more fine grained control over any aspect app you can also write your own css pass css file with css parameter interface class custom flagging options some cases you might like provide your users testers with more than just binary option flag sample you can provide flagging options that they select from dropdown each time they click flag button this lets them provide additional feedback every time they flag sample here s example python gr interface fn classify image inputs image outputs label flagging options incorrect ambiguous offensive other launch loading hugging face models spaces gradio integrates nicely with hugging face hub allowing you load models spaces with just one line code use this simply use load method interface class so load any model from hugging face hub create interface around you pass model huggingface followed by model name like these examples python gr interface load huggingface gpt launch python gr interface load huggingface eleutherai gpt j b inputs gr inputs textbox lines label input text customizes input component launch load any space from hugging face hub recreate locally so that you can customize inputs outputs example you pass spaces followed by model name python gr interface load spaces eugenesiow remove bg inputs webcam title remove your webcam background launch one great things about loading hugging face models spaces using gradio that you can then immediately use resulting interface object just like function your python code this works every type model space text images audio video even multimodal models python io gr interface load models eleutherai gpt neo b io was best times outputs model completion putting interfaces parallel series gradio also lets you mix interfaces very easily using gradio parallel gradio series classes parallel lets you put two similar models if they have same input type parallel compare model predictions python generator gr interface load huggingface gpt generator gr interface load huggingface eleutherai gpt neo b generator gr interface load huggingface eleutherai gpt j b gr parallel generator generator generator launch series lets you put models spaces series piping output one model into input next model python generator gr interface load huggingface gpt translator gr interface load huggingface t small gr series generator translator launch this demo generates text then translates german outputs final result course you can also mix parallel series together whenever that makes sense queuing manage long inference times if many people are using your interface if inference time your function long min simply set enable queue parameter launch method true prevent timeouts python gr interface fn classify image inputs image outputs label launch enable queue true this sets up queue workers handle predictions return response front end this strongly recommended if you are planning on uploading your demo hugging face spaces described above so that you can manage large number users simultaneously using your demo

transactional open source document database rethinkdb document database that supports queries like table joins group by key map data model note there some term confusion industry two different things are called columnar databases some listed here are distributed persistent databases built around key map data model all data has possibly composite key with which map key value pairs associated some systems multiple such value maps can associated with key these maps are referred column families with value map keys being referred columns another group technologies that can also called columnar databases distinguished by how stores data on disk memory rather than storing data traditional way where all column values given key are stored next each other row by row these systems store all column values next each other so more work needed get all columns given key but less work needed get all values given column former group referred key map data model here line between these key value data model stores fairly blurry latter being more about storage format than about data model listed under columnar databases you can read more about this distinction on prof daniel abadi s blog

": " english espa ol state art machine learning jax pytorch tensorflow transformers provides thousands pretrained models perform tasks on different modalities such text vision audio these models can applied on text tasks like text classification information extraction question answering summarization translation text generation over languages images tasks like image classification object detection segmentation audio tasks like speech recognition audio classification transformer models can also perform tasks on several modalities combined such table question answering optical character recognition information extraction from scanned documents video classification visual question answering transformers provides apis quickly download use those pretrained models on given text fine tune them on your own datasets then share them with community on our model hub at same time each python module defining architecture fully standalone can modified enable quick research experiments transformers backed by three most popular deep learning libraries jax pytorch tensorflow with seamless integration between them s straightforward train your models with one before loading them inference with other online demos you can test most our models directly on their pages from model hub we also offer private model hosting versioning inference api public private models here are few

pytorch neural network module tensorflow tensorflow keras model depending on your backend which you can use usual this tutorial explains how integrate such model into classic pytorch tensorflow training loop how use our trainer api quickly fine tune on new dataset why should i use transformers easy use state art models high performance on natural language understanding generation computer vision audio tasks low barrier entry educators practitioners few user facing abstractions with just three classes learn unified api using all our pretrained models lower compute costs smaller carbon footprint researchers can share trained models instead always retraining practitioners can reduce compute time production costs dozens architectures with over pretrained models across all modalities choose right framework every part model s lifetime train state art models lines code move single model between tensorflow pytorch jax frameworks at will seamlessly pick right framework training evaluation production easily customize model example your needs we provide examples each architecture reproduce results published by its original authors model internals are exposed consistently possible model files can used independently library quick experiments why shouldn t i use transformers this library not modular toolbox building blocks neural nets code model files not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose so that researchers can quickly iterate on each models without diving into additional abstractions files training api not intended work on any model but optimized work with models provided by library generic machine learning loops you should use another library possibly accelerate while we strive present many use cases possible scripts our examples folder are just that examples expected that they won t work out box on your specific problem that you will required change few lines code adapt them your needs installation with pip this repository tested on python flax pytorch tensorflow you should install transformers virtual environment if you re unfamiliar with python virtual environments check out user guide first create virtual environment with version python you re going use activate then you will need install at least one flax pytorch tensorflow please refer tensorflow installation page pytorch installation page flax jax installation pages regarding specific installation command your platform when one those backends has been installed transformers can installed using pip follows bash pip install transformers if you d like play with examples need bleeding edge code can t wait new release you must install library from source with conda since transformers version v we now have conda channel huggingface transformers can installed using conda follows shell script conda install c huggingface transformers follow installation pages flax pytorch tensorflow see how install them with conda note on windows you may prompted activate developer mode order benefit from caching if this not option you please let us know this issue model architectures all model checkpoints provided by transformers are seamlessly integrated from huggingface co model hub where they are uploaded directly by users organizations current number checkpoints transformers currently provides following architectures see here high level summary each

face location recognition work instead depending on black box library read my article caveats face recognition model trained on adults does not work very well on children tends mix up children quite easy using default comparison threshold accuracy may vary between ethnic groups please see this wiki page more details deployment cloud hosts heroku aws etc since face recognition depends on dlib which written c can tricky deploy app using cloud hosting provider like heroku aws make things easier there s example dockerfile this repo that shows how run app built with face recognition docker

completely ignored outside academia because code was confusing fragmentary required thorough understanding complicated artificial intelligence techniques took lot effort figure out until one individual brought together into single cohesive collection ran worked so often way with new technology emerging on internet was immediately used create inappropriate content despite inappropriate uses software was given originally was first artificial intelligence code that anyone could download run learn by experimentation without having ph d math computer theory psychology more before deepfakes these techniques were like black magic practiced by those who could understand all inner workings described esoteric endlessly complicated books papers deepfakes changed all that anyone could participate artificial intelligence development us developers release this code opened up fantastic learning opportunity allowed us build on ideas developed by others collaborate with variety skilled coders experiment with artificial intelligence whilst learning new skills ultimately contribute towards emerging technology which will see more mainstream use progresses are there some out there doing horrible things with similar software yes because this developers have been following strict ethical standards many us don t even use create videos we just tinker with code see what does sadly media concentrates on unethical uses this software that unfortunately nature how was first exposed public but not representative why was created how we use now what we see its future like any

darknet blob master build darknet x partial cmd if you made you custom model that isn t based on other models then you can train without pre trained weights then will used random initial weights when should i stop training usually sufficient iterations each class object but not less than number training images not less than iterations total but more precise definition when you should stop training use following manual during training you will see varying indicators error you should stop when no longer decreases xxxxxxx avg region avg iou class obj no obj avg recall count region avg iou class obj no obj avg recall count avg rate seconds images loaded seconds iteration number number batch avg average loss error lower better when you see that average loss xxxxxx avg no longer decreases at many iterations then you should stop training final average loss can from small model easy dataset big model difficult dataset if you train with flag map then you will see map indicator last accuracy map console this indicator better than loss so train while map increases once training stopped you should take some last weights files from darknet build darknet x backup choose best them example you stopped training after iterations but best result can give one previous weights can happen due over fitting over fitting case when you can detect objects on images from training dataset but can t

before training set flag random your cfg file will increase precision by training yolo different resolutions link increase network resolution your cfg file height width any value multiple will increase precision check that each object that you want detect mandatory labeled your dataset no one object your data set should not without label most training issues there are wrong labels your dataset got labels by using some conversion script marked with third party tool always check your dataset by using https github com alexeyab yolo mark my loss very high map very low training wrong run training with show imgs flag at end training command do you see correct bounded boxes objects windows files aug jpg if no your training dataset wrong each object which you want detect there must at least similar object training dataset with about same shape side object relative size angle rotation tilt illumination so desirable that your training dataset include images with objects at different scales rotations lightings from different sides on different backgrounds you should preferably have different images each class more you should train classes iterations more desirable that your training dataset include images with non labeled objects that you do not want detect negative samples without bounded box empty txt files use many images negative samples there are images with objects

dataset should include such set relative sizes objects that you want detect train network width train obj width train image width detection network width detection obj width detection image width train network height train obj height train image height detection network height detection obj height detection image height i e each object from test dataset there must at least object training dataset with same class id about same relative size object width percent from training dataset object width percent from test dataset that if objects that occupied image were present training set then trained network will not able detect objects that occupy image speedup training with decreasing detection accuracy set param stopbackward layer cfg file each model object side illumination scale each grad turn inclination angles these are different objects from internal perspective neural network so more different objects you want detect more complex network model should used make detected bounded boxes more accurate you can add parameters ignore thresh iou normalizer iou loss giou each yolo layer train will increase map but decrease map if you are expert neural detection network recalculate anchors your dataset width height from cfg file darknet exe detector calc anchors data obj data num clusters width height then set same anchors each yolo layers your cfg file but you should change indexes anchors masks each yolo layer so yolov st yolo layer has anchors smaller than x nd smaller than x rd remaining vice versa yolov also you should change filters classes before each yolo layer if many calculated anchors do not fit under appropriate layers then just try using all default anchors after training detection increase network resolution by set your cfg file height width height width any value multiple this increases precision makes possible detect small objects link not necessary train network again just use weights file already trained x resolution get even greater accuracy you should train with higher resolution x x note if error out memory occurs then cfg file you should increase subdivisions link how mark bounded boxes objects create annotation files here you can find

onnx from source before building from source uninstall any existing versions onnx pip uninstall onnx c higher c compiler version required build onnx from source on windows other platforms please use c higher versions generally speaking you need install protobuf c c libraries tools before proceeding forward then depending on how you installed protobuf you need set environment variable cmake args donnx use protobuf shared libs on donnx use protobuf shared libs off example you may need run following command linux bash export cmake args donnx use protobuf shared libs on windows bat set cmake args donnx use protobuf shared libs on on off depends on what kind protobuf library you have shared libraries are files ending with dll so dylib static libraries are files ending with lib this option depends on how you get your protobuf library how was built default off you don t need run commands above if you d prefer use static protobuf library windows if you are building onnx from source recommended that you also build protobuf locally static library version distributed with conda forge dll but onnx expects static library building protobuf locally also lets you control version protobuf tested recommended version instructions this readme assume you are using visual studio recommended that you run all commands from shell started from x native tools command prompt vs keep build system generator cmake e g cmake g visual studio consistent while building protobuf well onnx you can get protobuf by running following commands bat git clone https github com protocolbuffers

methodology something like practice learning practice that means where students first come with some existing projects with problems solutions practice get familiar with traditional methods area perhaps also with their methodology after practicing with some elementary experiences they can go into books study underlying theory which serves guide their future advanced practice will enhance their toolbox solving practical problems studying theory also further improves their understanding on elementary experiences will help them acquire advanced experiences more quickly s long plan s

tensorflow ": " tensorflow serving tensorflow serving flexible high performance serving system machine learning models designed production environments deals with inference aspect machine learning taking models after training managing their lifetimes providing clients with versioned access via high performance reference counted lookup table tensorflow serving provides out box integration with tensorflow models but can easily extended serve other types models data note few features can serve multiple models multiple versions same model simultaneously exposes both grpc well http inference endpoints allows deployment new model versions without changing any client code supports canarying new versions b testing experimental models adds minimal latency inference time due efficient low overhead implementation features scheduler that groups individual inference requests into batches joint execution on gpu with configurable latency controls supports many servables tensorflow models
