TeX works by reading a source file containing text and macro definitions which instruct the TeX engine how to typeset the document. It also reads TFM files containing character widths, ligatures, and other information relevant to a particular font. After processing the source document, TeX outputs a DVI file which is a device-independent binary file containing the positions of all characters in the document. The DVI file is then supposed to be processed by a device-specific program that combines the DVI file with the necessary fonts to create something that can be sent to a printer. Nowadays it is more common to use one of the extensions to TeX, e.g. pdfTeX which outputs a pdf file instead of a DVI file."

You can use it to automate GUI based applications as well as REST, RPC, SOAP and other API, and protocol based testing. Due to it's text based nature and cli tools RF is a perfect match for **agile** and DevOps, and DevSecOps driven projects striving to succeed in **continuous testing**. It integrates very well with open source and commercial CI/CD solutions like Jenkins, CircleCI, Github Actions, and Azure Pipelines - just to name a few. It is also developer friendly and can easily be versioned with Git, and used with Docker and other container and virtualisation technologies to support building and maintaining of scalable (test) environments following the `configuration as code` or `infrastructure as code` approach. RF can be used in projects of any technology stack, and runs on any infrastructure (Windows, Mac, Linux, cloud) - it is stack and infrastructure agnostic."
