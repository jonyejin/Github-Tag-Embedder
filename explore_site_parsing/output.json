It also reads TFM files containing character widths, ligatures, and other information relevant to a particular font. After processing the source document, TeX outputs a DVI file which is a device-independent binary file containing the positions of all characters in the document. The DVI file is then supposed to be processed by a device-specific program that combines the DVI file with the necessary fonts to create something that can be sent to a printer. Nowadays it is more common to use one of the extensions to TeX, e.g. pdfTeX which outputs a pdf file instead of a DVI file."

You can use it to automate GUI based applications as well as REST, RPC, SOAP and other API, and protocol based testing. Due to it's text based nature and cli tools RF is a perfect match for **agile** and DevOps, and DevSecOps driven projects striving to succeed in **continuous testing**. It integrates very well with open source and commercial CI/CD solutions like Jenkins, CircleCI, Github Actions, and Azure Pipelines - just to name a few. It is also developer friendly and can easily be versioned with Git, and used with Docker and other container and virtualisation technologies to support building and maintaining of scalable (test) environments following the `configuration as code` or `infrastructure as code` approach. RF can be used in projects of any technology stack, and runs on any infrastructure (Windows, Mac, Linux, cloud) - it is stack and infrastructure agnostic."

It originates from the greenhouse effect of certain gases in our atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) or methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) that block the escaping heat. The concentration of these gases has risen dramatically by human impact since the mid of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, with the burning of fossil fuels (oil and gas) and deforestation being main causes of this rise. The observed and expected effects include more and longer periods of draught, wildfires and an increased number of extreme weather events."

The instruction set is designed for a wide range of uses. The base instruction set has a fixed length of 32-bit naturally aligned instructions, and the ISA supports variable length extensions where each instruction could be an any number of 16-bit parcels in length. Subsets support small embedded systems, personal computers, supercomputers with vector processors, and warehouse-scale 19 inch rack-mounted parallel computers."
